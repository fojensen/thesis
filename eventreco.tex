\chapter{Object Definition and Event Reconstruction}
\label{chap:eventreco}

Our jets are reconstructed using the ``anti-kt`` clustering algorithm with cone sizes of $\Delta R$ = 0.4, 0.8 \cite{1126-6708-2008-04-063}, denoted as AK4 and AK8 jets respectively. AK4 jets subtend less solid angle and are used to capture the hadronisation of single quarks and gluons. AK8 jets subtend a larger solid angle and are used for reconstruction of boosted objects (e.g. $t$, H, Z, W).

Particle Flow event reconstruction is pretty good.\cite{CMS-PRF-14-001}
