A search for physics beyond the SM was presented using events with boosted H bosons and missing transverse energy (\ptmiss). The search targeted events with two or more wide-angle jets (AK8) being consistent with the decay of a boosted H or Z boson decaying to \bbbar. \ptmiss could potentially arise in the case a supersymmetric particle escapes detection. An ABCD method uses a sideband region to predict the the SM background in our signal region. Events are categorized according to the \bbbar and mass tagging of the leading two AK8 jets in the event. The observed yields in the 6 signal bins are statistically compatible with the SM background expectation and no excess of events is observed. We use these results to set limits on the gluino mass for the SUSY-inspired T5HH or T5ZH models. For the T5HH model we are able to exclude gluino masses below 2010 GeV at 95\% confidence level. This is with the assumption the NLSP mass is 50 GeV less than the gluino mass and that the LSP has a mass of 1 GeV. The work presented here has been published in a peer-reviewed journal\cite{CMS-SUS-17-006}.
