This thesis presents a search for evidence of physics beyond the SM. The search targets events with two or more wide-angle jets (AK8) being consistent with boosted H or Z bosons decaying to \bbbar. The analysis makes use a dedicated heavy-flavor tagging algorithm used to identify large angle jets composed of two b quarks. We additionally require a large amount of \ptmiss potentially arising from a supersymmetric particle escaping detection. A data-driven method uses yields in 12 sideband bins to predict the background in 6 signal bins. Events are categorized according to the \bbbar-tagging and masses of the highest two \pt AK8 jets, and the amount of \ptmiss. Backgrounds arise from QCD jet production, jets+$Z\rightarrow\nu\bar{\nu}$, jets+$W\rightarrow\ell\nu$, and $t\bar{t}\rightarrow q q' \ell \nu$, in which the leptons are not identified. These backgrounds are studied by defining control regions expected to be enhanced in each of these processes. In combination with simulation, these control regions are additionally used to derive corrections to the background prediction. 

The observed yields in the signal bins are statistically compatible with the background expectation, and no excess of events is observed. A maximum-likelihood fit allows us to set limits on the cross section of gluino-pair production under the assumption of the T5ZH or T5HH decay models. Comparisons of our limits with the theoretical cross sections allow us to exclude gluinos with masses below 2010 and 1825 GeV at 95\% confidence level for the T5HH and T5ZH models, respectively. These limits are made with the assumption that the NLSP mass is 50 GeV less than the gluino mass, and that the LSP has a mass of 1 GeV.
